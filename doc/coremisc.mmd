Soloud.getStreamTime()
----------------------

The getStreamTime function can be used to get the current play position,
in seconds.

    double t = soloud.getStreamTime(h); // get time
    if (t == hammertime) hammer();

Note that time is a double instead of float because float will 
cause precision problems within 24 hours of playing, and eventually,
in about 6 days, will cause the "time" to stop. 

Also note that the granularity is likely to be rather high (possibly
around 45ms), so using this as the sole clock source for animation will
lead to rather low framerate (possibly around 20Hz). To fix this, either
use some other clock source and only sync with the stream time
occasionally, or use some kind of low-pass filter, such as..

    mytime = (mytime * 9 + soloud.getStreamTime(h)) / 10;
    
While not perfect, that's way better than using the stream time directly.

Soloud.isValidVoiceHandle()
-----------------------------

The isValidVoiceHandle function can be used to check if a handle is
still valid.

    if (!soloud.isValidVoiceHandle(h)) delete foobar;

If the handle is invalid, the isValidVoiceHandle will return 0.

Soloud.getActiveVoiceCount()
----------------------------

Returns the number of concurrent sounds that are playing at the moment.

    if (soloud.getActiveVoiceCount() == 0) enjoy_the_silence();

If the handle is invalid, the getActiveVoiceCount will return 0.

Soloud.setGlobalFilter()
------------------------

Sets, or clears, the global filter.

    soloud.setGlobalFilter(0, &echochamber); // set first filter

Setting the global filter to NULL will clear the global filter. The
default maximum number of global filters active is 4, but this can be
changed in a global constant in soloud.h (and rebuilding SoLoud).

Soloud.calcFFT()
----------------

Calculates FFT of the currently playing sound (post-clipping) and
returns a pointer to the result.

    float * fft = soloud.calcFFT();
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 256; i++)
      drawline(0, i, fft[i] * 32, i);

The FFT data has 256 floats, from low to high frequencies.

SoLoud performs a mono mix of the audio, passes it to FFT, and then
calculates the magnitude of the complex numbers for application to use.
For more advanced FFT use, SoLoud code changes are needed.

The returned pointer points at a buffer that's always around, but the
data is only updated when calcFFT() is called.

For the FFT to work, you also need to initialize SoLoud with the
Soloud::ENABLE\_VISUALIZATION flag, or by enabling visualization with
the Soloud.setVisualizationEnable() call. Otherwise the source data for the
FFT calculation will not be gathered.

Soloud.getWave()
----------------

Gets 256 samples of the currently playing sound (post-clipping) and
returns a pointer to the result.

    float * wav = soloud.getWave();
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 256; i++)
      drawline(0, i, wav[i] * 32, i);

The returned pointer points at a buffer that's always around, but the
data is only updated when getWave() is called. The data is the same that
is used to generate visualization FFT data.

For this function to work properly, you also need to initialize SoLoud
with the Soloud::ENABLE\_VISUALIZATION flag or by enabling visualization with
the Soloud.setVisualizationEnable() call. Otherwise the source data
will not be gathered, and the result is undefined (probably zero).

Soloud.getVersion()
-------------------

Returns the version of the SoLoud library. Same as SOLOUD_VERSION macro.
Mostly useful when using the DLL, to check the DLL's library version.

    if (soloud.getVersion() != SOLOUD_VERSION)
        panic();

Soloud.getErrorString()
-----------------------

Converts SoLoud's error values to printable zero-terminated ascii strings.

    int err = mod.load("foo.mod")
    printf("Mod load:%s", soloud.getErrorString(err));
    
Soloud.setDelaySamples()
------------------------

Sets number of samples to delay before starting to play a sound. This is
used internally by the playClocked() function. In the unlikely event that
you may want to use it manually, it's available in the public API.

    h = soloud.play(snd, 1, 0, 1); // start paused
    soloud.setDelaySamples(h, 44100); // delay for a second
    soloud.setPause(h, 0); // go
    
Calling this on a "live" voice will cause silence to be inserted at the
start of the next audio buffer. Since this is rather unpredictable (as
audio buffer sizes may vary), it's not recommended, even if it may be a
rather funky effect..

Soloud.getLoopCount()
---------------------

Some sound sources that support looping also keep count of the loop count.
This can be useful at least to detect when some sound loops.

    int c = soloud.getLoopCount(h);
    if (c != old_c)
        printf("Looped!);
    old_c = c;
    
Invalid handles and unsupported sound sources will cause the function to
return 0.
