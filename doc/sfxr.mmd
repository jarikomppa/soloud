SoLoud::Sfxr
===========

The SoLoud::Sfxr is a "retro" sound effect synthesizer based
on the original Sfxr by Tomas Pettersson.

![Sfxr interface](images/sfxr)

The original sfxr tool was designed to easily generate sound
effects for Ludum Dare 48h games. SoLoud includes the same
engine built in, so you can (should you wish) make every
coin, explosion etc. sound different.

The Sfxr sound sources also include a pseudo-random number
generator which should probably be moved to more general use
at some point.

Sfxr.loadPreset()
-----------------

You can simply tell Sfxr to use one of the presets 
(COIN, LASER, EXPLOSION, POWERUP, HURT, JUMP, BLIP). Each of the
presets has several random components, so you can get virtually
unlimited variations of each. (Not all variants sound good, though).

    void loadPreset(int aPresetNo, int aRandSeed); // Preset to load

If loading fails, the function returns an error code.

    SoLoud::Sfxr coin;
    coin.loadPreset(Sfxr::COIN, 3247);

Sfxr.loadParams()
----------

Effect parameters can also be loaded from a configuration file
saved from the sfxr tool.

    result loadParams(const char *aFilename); // File to load

If loading fails, the function returns an error code.

    SoLoud::Sfxr boom;
    boom.loadParams("boom.sfx");

Sfxr.resetParams()
------------------

This function resets all of the Sfxr parameters to a "sensible" default.
Used by loadPreset(), which then only adjusts a few parameters over the
defaults.

Sfxr.setLooping()
-----------------

Adjusting the looping of a sfxr sound does not currently
have any effect. The sounds do not loop.

Sfxr.setFilter()
----------------

As with any other audio source, you can attach filters to 
Sfxr audio sources.

    gMusic.setFilter(0, &gLofi);

Sfxr.stop()
-----------

You can stop all instances of a Sfxr sound source with
stop(). This is equivalent of calling soloud.stopAudioSource()
with the sound source.

    gBoom.stop();

Prg.srand()
-----------

Initializes the pseudo-random number generator to a seed number.

   rnd.srand(7);
   
Prg.rand()
----------

Returns the next 32bit pseudo-random number.

   if (rnd.rand() & 1)
      printf("Heads");
   else
      printf("Tails");
      
Inherited 3d audio interfaces
-----------------------------
Like all other audio sources, Sfxr inherits the 3d audio interfaces. Please refer to the 3d audio chapter for details on:

- Sfxr.set3dMinMaxDistance()
- Sfxr.set3dAttenuation()
- Sfxr.set3dDopplerFactor()
- Sfxr.set3dProcessing()
- Sfxr.set3dListenerRelative()
- Sfxr.set3dDistanceDelay()
- Sfxr.set3dCollider()
