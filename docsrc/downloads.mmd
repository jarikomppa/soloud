    - New demo: "space", demonstrating visualization data from different parts of the pipeline
    - New demo: "pew pew", demonstrating difference between play() and playClocked()
    - New filter: flanger
    - New way to play sounds: playClocked() for rapidly-launched sounds, to make it so all sounds don't start from the beginning of a sound buffer
    - Loop count query added

- A lot of variable type changes:
    - Defined error codes, and several functions return error codes now.
    - Time variable type changed from float to double
    - Typedefs for handles, time, result codes
    - Plenty of "int" -> "unsigned int" changes, some ints changed to bools
- A lot of work on code generation and wrappers:
    - Codegen now also outputs soloud_codegen.py with all data needed to generate wrappers
    - Python wrapper generator
    - Python API
- Other changes that affect your code:
    - stopSound() renamed to stopAudioSource(). Audio sources also got a new stop() function that stops all instances.

    - sdl2 dll may work now (mutex functions were renamed from SDL to SDL2, audio API should be almost the same)
- And, under the hood:
    - Side project - resamplerlab - to make writing new resamplers easier, with some experimental resamplers
    - Some work towards osx, linux compatibility
    - FFT code moved to its own source so it can be more easily replaced in the future

[soloud_20130808.zip](soloud_20130808.zip)

- They grow so fast! Hilights:
- Redesigned, simpler filter system. Probably still needs a lot of work.
- Added a FFT library and calls to get FFT data from SoLoud. This can be disabled via a #define to improve compile time.
- Added stopSound() to stop all instances of a sound. This is also called from the dtor of audio sources for simpler application cleanup.
- Tweaked and improved all demos.
- Volume faders are calculated on per-sample basis instead of per-buffer, this removed plenty of noise.
- Added getPan.
- and various bugfixes and CppCheck fixes.

[soloud_20130801.zip](soloud_20130801.zip)

- Initial release. If you're after something really minimalistic, dig in.

The package contains all sources, and pre-compiled win32 binaries. The sources should(tm) be portable to other platforms.
