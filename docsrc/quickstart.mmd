## Quick Start

This quick start is for c++ developers. If you're using SoLoud with
some other environment SoLoud supports, you may want to skip this and
look at the chapter that covers your environment (such as Python).

#### Download SoLoud


First, you need to download SoLoud sources. You can find the downloads
on the <http://soloud-audio.com/downloads.html> page.

#### Add SoLoud to your project


There's a few ways to include SoLoud to your project. Probably the
easiest is to use GENie / premake4 to create the build files, and build a 
static library for your compiler / environment.

Note that the Windows DLL only exports the  "C" API, which may not 
be what you want.

You can go the lazy way and just add all of the sources to your project,
or you can copy the things you need to a single directory and include
those. 

You'll need the core files, at least one backend, and at least one 
audio source. For example, for wav file playing, you'll need the files from
audiosource/wav. 

If you go this route, you'll need to enable one or more of the back-ends 
via preprocessor defines. The current list is:

Preprocessor macro  Description
----                ------------
WITH_SDL            SDL or SDL2 via runtime dyndll linking
WITH_SDL1           SDL1 via runtime dyndll linking
WITH_SDL2           SDL2 via runtime dyndll linking
WITH_SDL_STATIC     SDL via normal static linking
WITH_SDL2           SDL or SDL2 via runtime dyndll linking
WITH_SDL2_STATIC    SDL2 via normal static linking
WITH_PORTAUDIO      Portaudio via runtime dyndll linking
WITH_OPENAL         OpenAL via runtime dyndll linking (high latency)
WITH_XAUDIO2        XAudio2 via normal linking
WITH_WINMM          Windows multimedia 
WITH_WASAPI         WASAPI (experimental)
WITH_OSS            Linux OSS
WITH_ALSA           Linux ALSA
WITH_OPENSLES       OpenSL ES
WITH_COREAUDIO		OSX CoreAudio
WITH_VITA_HOMEBREW	Sony Vita homebrew backend
WITH_NULL           No audio device

The backend with no audio device may seem odd, but that can be used to
call SoLoud's mix function manually, which can be useful in some cases
such as LibRetro.

#### Include files


In order to use a certain feature of SoLoud, you need to include its
header file. You might have, for instance:

    #include "soloud.h"
    #include "soloud_wav.h"

#### Variables


You need at least the SoLoud engine core, and one or more of the audio
source variables. If you're using five different sound effect wav files,
you need five SoLoud::Wav objects. You can play one object any number of
times, even on top of itself.

Where to place these is up to you. Globals work, as do allocation from
heap, including in a class as members, etc. Stack is probably a bad idea,
but I'm not stopping you.

    SoLoud::Soloud gSoloud; // SoLoud engine
    SoLoud::Wav gWave;      // One wave file

#### Initialize SoLoud


In your application, once you have your framework up (for instance after your 
SDL\_Init call), include a call to initialize SoLoud.

    gSoloud.init(); // Initialize SoLoud
    
The call has a bunch of optional parameters if you'd rather pick the replay
back-end and its parameters yourself; the default should work for most cases.

#### Set up sound sources


This step varies from one audio source to another, but basically you'll
load your wave files here.

    gWave.load("pew_pew.wav"); // Load a wave

\pagebreak

#### Play sounds


Now you're ready to play the sounds. Place playing commands wherever you
need sound to be played.

    gSoloud.play(gWave); // Play the wave

Note that you can play the same sound several times, and it doesn't cut
itself off (but if that's what you want, there's an option for that too).

#### Take control of the sound


You can adjust various things about the sound you're playing if you take
the handle.

    int x = gSoloud.play(gWave); // Grab the handle
    gSoloud.setPan(x, -0.2f);    // Use handle to adjust panning

Read the soloud.h header file (or this documentation) for further things
you can do.

#### Cleanup


After you've done, remember to clean up. If you don't, the audio thread
may do stupid things while the application is shutting down.

    gSoloud.deinit(); // Clean up!

#### Enjoy

And you're done!

Some useful notes:

Most calls to SoLoud also return some kind of return code which may
help you diagnose potential problems. When loading wave files, for instance,
you may want to check if the file is actually found.

Many of the calls also have additional optional parameters, and there are
also alternate calls to do (almost) the same thing (Wav::load() and 
WavStream::loadToMem() as an example).

Finally, SoLoud has been designed so that you can ignore most of the return values.
If there's an error state, such as wav file failing to load, further calls,
like trying to play the wav file that didn't load, will simply do nothing.
